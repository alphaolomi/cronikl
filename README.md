# Cronikl

Cronikl is a neat little app that lets you manage cron jobs with a simple UI, running commands on the schedule you define.

It was built as a working demonstration of the [NativePHP framework](https://nativephp.com/) of which I am one of the maintainers.

Cronikl is just a Laravel application that uses the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/) running in the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) variant of NativePHP.

**NB: You need to leave the app open for the scheduler to run your tasks.**

Cronikl currently supports macOS only, but Linux and Windows support is coming.

## Dist

Just want to install Cronikl? A production build will be available soon.

## Dev

### Installation

Clone this repository (or your fork of it) and run `composer install` to install the dependencies.

Then run `cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate` to create your `.env` file and generate an application key.

### Booting the dev build

Run `php artisan native:serve` to start the application.

## Learn NativePHP

NativePHP is fairly new but already has lots of [documentation](https://nativephp.com/docs)
